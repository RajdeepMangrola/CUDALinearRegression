To use make sure you have CUDA 4.2 and CULA Dense R15 installed (all the environment variables must be set and shared libraries visible).

then:
1) 'cd' to src and run 'g++ -o pop.o populate.cpp'.
2) run './pop.o'

You will be prompted for number of entries. The output will be X.csv and Y.csv which represents the independant and dependant variables respectively. Edit source code of populate.cpp to change the coefficients or increase number of variables as needed. 

after that:
1) run 'make'
2) run './main.o'
you will get the calculated values of the coefficients.

You can also use the Matrix Class to do the operations as listed at the top of the file.
